  title: About Us
  description: Open Noise Monitoring Network develops a set of connectors to open
    data platforms in order to acquire, standardize, and store the  environmental
    noise data, to provide them to stakeholders.
  content: "The increase in institutional transparency has led to the proliferation
    of open data platforms where local authorities share information about many urban
    subjects, including environmental noise.\n\nThe access to these environmental
    noise content is done in a particular way in each platform, moreover in many of
    them it is not possible to access the historical data, and the data is presented
    with different structures. These limitations create problems for researchers and
    specialists who want to obtain information from different cities for their projects. "
