  description: ''
  content: |-
    Increased institutional transparency has led to the proliferation of open data platforms where local authorities share information on many urban subjects, including the environmental noise.
    The access to the data, which is usually presented with different structures, is done differently on each platform, and in many of them it is not possible to access historical noise data. These limitations create problems for researchers and specialists who want to obtain information from different cities for their projects, being this the problem that ONMN wants to solve.
