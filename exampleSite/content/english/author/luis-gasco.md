\+4 years of experience analyzing data from urban environments, and +3 years analyzing texts from social networks, in which I have applied machine learning technologies, natural language processing, open data, and statistics trying to detect problems in cities and transport infrastructures.

I am an enthusiast in the application of new technologies to identify and solve problems in society. This type of project allows me to improve my communication and data visualization skills, something essential when multiple areas of knowledge converge, and to acquire a global vision of the problems that exist in large cities and transport infrastructures. During my career, I have worked in an international environment on projects in France and the UK, as well as been trained in entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and innovation management in several European cities within the framework of the EIT Digital Doctoral School.
