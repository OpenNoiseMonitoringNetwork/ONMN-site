During the last months we have suffered the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a blink of an eye, every aspect of our lives have changed, most of the European population have suffered hard lockdown, where people were not allowed to go on the streets to not essential activities such as go to work and goint to supermarkets. 

These effects have changed the cities' soundscape. Suddently, the transportation and leisure noise, have dissapeared from our lives and other natural sounds that were usually masked by anthropogenic sounds, emerged in cities again. All these changes are being investigated by initiatives such as  BLA BLA BLA BLA BLA. But once again, when the noise levels in cities wanted to be compared, the lack of standardization appears.
